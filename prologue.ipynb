    "The modern Data Scientist doesn't always need to know the mathematics that go on behind the scenes, but they _do_ need to be intimately familiar with the characteristics of the various machine learning algorithms - e.g. which types of data they are suitable for, how to measure their accuracy, and how to interpret their output. \n",
    "\n",
    "To _design_ and _assess_ the validity of your data models, you'll at least need a **statistics** vocabulary equivalent to one offered by college-level  course. The materials referenced in this guide provide a succinct refresher. But as you'll also want to _implement_ and _iterate_ over your data models once you've designed them, you also need some **programming** skills. Data Scientists often work with a scripting language with strong machine learning libraries. _R_ is a common contender, but for the purposes of this introduction _Python_ is used to teach you the basics of computational thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the following banners will lead you to an online resource which will  set you on your journey as fledgling Data Science. The topics presented here are both wide and deep, so where appropriate, the _minimum_ requirements are  listed. Data Science is an intellectually challenging pursuit, but let that not deter you. Data Scientists are often just better statisticians than most programmers, and better programmers than most statisticians. It's through a hybrid of the two domains that they develop their invaluable skill-set."
