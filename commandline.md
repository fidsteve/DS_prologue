### Command Line

The popular introductory manual 'Learn Python the Hard Way' comes with an appendix about the command line. It's a crash course in using the command line to make your computer perform tasks. As a crash course, it's not as detailed or extensive as dedicated guides. It is simply designed to get you barely capable enough to start using your computer like a real programmer does. When you're done with the appendix, you will be able to give most of the basic commands that every shell user touches every day. You'll understand the basics of directories and a few other concepts.

Learing how to use the command line is important because if you want to learn to code, then you _must_ learn this. Programming languages are advanced ways to control your computer with language. The command line is the baby little brother of programming languages. Learning the command line teaches you to control the computer using language. Once you get past that, you can then move on to writing code and feeling like you actually own the hunk of metal in front of you.
